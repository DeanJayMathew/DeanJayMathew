Dean Jay Mathew

I'm a British (UK) citizen with 10+ years of SaaS, open-source software and cyber security experience supporting world-renowned universities and intergovernmental organisations. I have led the delivery of large-scale multi-layered global technology solutions, working for diverse high-profile teams from UNESCO and the Singapore National Quantum Computing Hub and its partners. I have a demonstrated and fast-growing set of technical skills to match my leadership experience. I'm a relaxed yet energetic, hard working, positive, comtemplative and kind person (a model citizen), but I'm well grounded in reality, down to earth, and logical in my approaches to work. My hobbies include online gaming (Apex Legends - Caustic), boxing a heavy bag, rugby, water sommelier (oh yeah - not all water is created equally!), and working hard every day to provide and be the best dad I can be to my kids.

My current focus is cybersecurity and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), with a strong emphasis on FIPS compliance and standards adoption. I can engineer and deploy hybrid classical/PQC servers and applications using ML-KEM (Kyber), ML-DSA (Dilithium), and SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+). My work directly aligns with FIPS 203/204/205 algorithm standards and the FIPS 140-3 validation pipeline, bridging the gap from research prototypes to compliance-ready product implementations. I take emerging cryptographic research and build it into practical, standards-compliant systems that can be deployed in regulated industries across the U.S., UK, and EU.
